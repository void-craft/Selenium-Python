## Projects:

### Magneto_Advanced
The script uses Selenium WebDriver on a demo shopping website to simulate user actions, such as clicking on links, filling in forms, and hovering over images. It also uses the Selenium Select class to interact with dropdown menus and the ActionChains class to perform mouse-over actions. Time.sleep() is used to introduce delays between actions.

### Google_Performance_Test
The script launches a new Chrome window, navigates to the Google search engine, rejects cookies, performs a search for "Chennai", opens and closes the image, news, and maps tabs, and takes screenshots at each step while measuring the time it takes for each action. Finally, the script quits the browser. The purpose of this script is to measure the performance of the Google search engine.

### Saucedemo_Assert
The code uses the Selenium library to automate a web browser to visit saucedemo website and performs actions such as clicking on buttons and filling out form fields. It also uses the assert keyword to check that the expected total matches the actual total and raise an error if they don't match.

### BBC_Webscraping
This script uses Selenium to open a browser, navigate to the BBC News website, reject cookies, click on various links to go to the India news section, and print the news headlines from the page.

### Google_Switching_Tabs
This script opens a Chrome browser, navigates to Google.com, rejects cookies, enters a search query for "cute black cats" and switches to the image results tab.
