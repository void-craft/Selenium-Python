# Selenium-Python

Description:
This repository contains Selenium/Python projects to showcase my ability to automate tests and to perform webscraping.

# Project List:

Magneto_Advanced
This repository contains a Selenium project that simulates user actions on a demo shopping website using Selenium WebDriver. It includes actions such as clicking on links, filling out forms, and hovering over images. The script also uses the Selenium Select and ActionChains classes to interact with dropdown menus and perform mouse-over actions. Time.sleep() is used to introduce delays between actions.

Google_Performance_Test
This repository contains a Selenium project that measures the performance of the Google search engine. The script launches a Chrome browser, performs a search for "Chennai", opens and closes various tabs while taking screenshots and measuring the time it takes for each action.

Saucedemo_Assert
This repository contains a Selenium project that automates a web browser to visit saucedemo website and performs various actions such as clicking on buttons and filling out form fields. The script also uses the assert keyword to check if the expected and actual totals match.

BBC_Webscraping
This repository contains a Selenium project that uses web scraping techniques to navigate to the BBC News website, reject cookies, and print out news headlines from the India section.

Google_Switching_Tabs
This repository contains a Selenium project that opens a Chrome browser, performs a search for "cute black cats" on Google, and switches to the image results tab.
